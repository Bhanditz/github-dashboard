Dashboard
=========

**This is a Chrome extension for filtering the activity feed on github.com dashboard.**

GitHub activity feed is filled with tons of different activities. I care some of them, some time, but not all the time.
I have always thought that I want an **activity filter** like this, but I don't know for sure if it's going to be helpful, so I thought I make this to test it out.
