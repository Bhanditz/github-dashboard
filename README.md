Dashboard
=========

**This is a Chrome extension for filtering the activity feed on github.com dashboard.**

GitHub activity feed is filled with tons of different activities. I care about some of them, sometimes, but not all the time.
I always thought that it would be good to have an **activity filter** like this, but I didn't know for sure if it would be helpful. So I made this to find out.
